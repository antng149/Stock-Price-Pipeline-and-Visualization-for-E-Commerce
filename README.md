#OVERVIEW

This project utilizes a Lambda function to generate near real-time finance data records for interactive querying. The project also generates a real-time data pipeline for finance data records for interactive querying. Specifically, we will use the yfinance module and we will grab pricing information for each of the following e-commerce stocks:
●	Amazon (AMZN)
●	Alibaba Group (BABA)
●	Walmart (WMT)
●	eBay (EBAY)
●	Shopify (SHOP)
●	Target (TGT)
●	Best Buy (BBY)
●	The Home Depot (HD)
●	Costco (COST)
●	Kroger (KR)

We are collecting one full day’s worth of stock HIGH and LOW prices for each company listed above between April 3rd, 2023, and April 14th, 2023, at a five-minute interval. Furthermore, use the database to write and run a query that includes the average volatility, the highest volatility, and the lowest volatility per company per day from the list above. Lastly, we’ll take the query results to generate 2 visualizations and give conclusion or opinion on the results.
